# ApeGuard

This projects aims to improve safety for wallet users, by providing an API identifying protocol's trusted assets (such as contract addresses and domain names). This trusted assets database will be available **on-chain** and **managed by a DAO**. Each protocol's DAOs will be able to maintain their own trusted assets.

This protocol is currently in building phase 🏗️

Next steps :
- Add events to contracts
- Add annotations
- Implement tokenomics

Tokenomics (in very simple schema, may change as I'm not a pro in tokenomics) :
