# ApeGuard

This projects aims to improve safety for wallet users, by providing an API identifying protocol's trusted assets (such as contract addresses and domain names). This trusted assets database will be available **on-chain** and **managed by a DAO**. Each protocol's DAOs will be able to maintain their own trusted assets.
